Rulo

##The Project
Rulo is a unique buying and selling application that allows users to buy individual items for bulk prices. Through the app, users can create events centered around a specific bargain. Then, nearby users can request to join these events, and soon meet up in person to make the purchase. Members also have the opportunity to rate and comment on their experience with other users, which helps hosts discern who they want to bargain buy with.

With a light and sleek design, Rulo will let you enjoy saving those grocery dollars.

##Installation Instructions:

##Areas for improvement
* Google maps functionality will need improvement. It should help you get to your location, and in the future perhaps even show you your group mates
* Events can be made more flexible to allow for future scheduling. The app is currently optomized for "I'm in Costco and want to buy this now" type circumstances
* Mobile optomization, and eventually maybe app deployment, are a critical next step in Rulo's development
* Increasing notifications to notify of more things and to include text or email
